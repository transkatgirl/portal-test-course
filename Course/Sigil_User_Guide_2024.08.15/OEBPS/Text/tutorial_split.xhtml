  <h2>Create Files For Each Chapter</h2>

  <p>If you loaded an HTML file into Sigil, this usually means all of your text and chapters are in one large file. This is allowed, but the standard practice with EPUBs is to put each chapter in your book into a separate HTML file. The smaller file sizes are needed for some e-readers to read your book, but it also makes your EPUB much faster to display and easier to edit.</p>

  <div class="tip">
    <p class="tiptext">Since most e-readers start a new file in the EPUB on a new page, it means your chapters will also start on a new page.</p>
  </div>

  <h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Create One File Per Chapter</h3>

  <p>The easiest way to split your book into separate files is to use the Split At Cursor button <img alt="Split at Cursor icon" src="../Images/split-section.png"/> wherever you want to start a new file.</p>

  <p>For example, to start a chapter on a new page, click just to the left of the chapter heading so that your cursor is at the start of the line:</p>

  <div class="image">
    <img alt="Selecting a good location to split a file in Code View." src="../Images/tutorial-split-select.png"/>
  </div>

  <p>Now click the Split At Cursor button <img alt="Split at Cursor icon." src="../Images/split-section.png"/> to split the text into two parts:</p>

  <div class="image">
    <img alt="Showling newly split-off file in BookBrowser" src="../Images/tutorial-split-2.png"/>
  </div>

  <p>You can see that everything after where you split is now in a new file called “Section0001.html”.</p>

  <p>If you look at the original file you can see it only contains the text before where you split:</p>

  <div class="image">
    <img alt="Showing original file with the split-off text removed" src="../Images/tutorial-split-1.png"/>
  </div>

  <p>You can continue splitting every chapter in your book, and putting any section that should start on a new page in a separate file.</p>

  <p>If you want to rename your files, see the <a href="book_browser.xhtml#book_browser_rename">Rename</a> section. This includes how to rename many files at once, e.g. Chapter_1, Chapter_2, etc..</p>
