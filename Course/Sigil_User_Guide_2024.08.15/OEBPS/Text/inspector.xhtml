  <h2 id="customize">Using the Page Inspector</h2>

  <p class="h1subheading">— Inspect the DOM of Your Page —</p>

<p>At the bottom of the Preview window is a button that displays
the Inspector tool. The icon looks like this:</p>
<div class="image">
<img alt="Page Inspector tool icon." src="../Images/tutorial-inspector.png"/>
</div>

<p>When you click on the button, the Page Inspector tool is displayed.
</p>
<div class="image">
<img alt="Inspector window" src="../Images/tutorial-inspector-window.png"/>
</div>

<p>The Page Inspector allows you to inspect and modify the Document Object Model
(DOM) of the page being viewed in the Preview window.</p>

<p>The DOM is a memory-resident version of the page that you have
composed using HTML. Sigil parses the HTML file and creates a tree
structure in memory that represents the information you have entered
into the HTML. The Preview Page is
actually displaying what is in the DOM.</p>

<p>If you are interested in learning more about the DOM, you
can find those details at:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp
">https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp</a>
</p>

<p>Since the DOM is a memory-resident version of your page, you can
change it on the fly and see the results immediately in the preview.</p>
<p>
The Inspector allows you to inspect and modify the DOM as you like.
That makes it possible for you to change the contents of the page,
and/or the style sheets and see the results of those changes immediately
in the preview.</p>

<div class="tip">
<p class="tiptext">Since you are changing only the DOM in memory, none of the
changes that you make in the Inspector will change your HTML file.</p>
</div>

<p>When you first open the Inspector, the DOM tree shows two
nodes with arrows,
<img alt="Inspector Expand DOM tree using arrows." src="../Images/tutorial-inspector-window-arrow.png"/>
, pointing to the right, as you can see in the previous figure.
There is one for the &lt;head&gt; tag and one for the &lt;body&gt; tag.
If you click on one of the arrows, the tree
expands so show the contents of that node, as shown below.</p>
<div class="image">
<img alt="Inspector window DOM node level 1" src="../Images/tutorial-inspector-window-level1.png"/>
</div>

<p>In the figure above, you can see that the &lt;body&gt; tag has been expanded to show
the contents of the body. Clicking successively on the arrows allows
you to dig down through the tree of nodes.</p>
<div class="image">
<img alt="Inspector window DOM node level 2" src="../Images/tutorial-inspector-window-level2.png"/>
</div>

<p>When you select one of the tags in the tree, the window on the
right hand side displays the style information about that node.</p>
<div class="image">
<img alt="Inspector window showing styles applied." src="../Images/tutorial-inspector-window-styles.png"/>
</div>

<p>You can see that the styles applied to that node are
shown in the Styles panel. Of particular interest is the figure in the lower right hand
corner of the Styles panel. That is called a Box Model.</p>
<div class="image">
<img alt="Inspector window show Box Model dimensions" src="../Images/tutorial-inspector-window-boxmodel.png"/>
</div>

<p>The box model shows the values of position, margin, border, padding and contents of the node. The units of the 
numbers shown are pixels. So you can tell from the image above that the selected
paragraph has a top and bottom margin of 16 pixels, no border, no padding, and is
288 pixels wide and 72 pixels tall.</p>



<p>Another way that you can select a node for inspection is
to use the Element Tool, which allows you to select the desired
node in the Preview panel. Activate the Element Tool by clicking the
button in the upper left corner of the Inspector window,
indicated by the mouse cursor in the figure below.</p>
<div class="image">
<img alt="Inspector element tool" src="../Images/tutorial-inspector-element-tool.png"/>
</div>

<p>Once you have
activated the Element Tool, you can select the desired element
in the Preview panel. The elements in the Preview panel are
highlighted as you track the mouse cursor over them.
</p>
<div class="image">
<img alt="Inspector Element Selection" src="../Images/tutorial-inspector-element-selection.png"/>
</div>

<p>Simply click on the highlighted element.
Once you have selected a node in the Elements tree, you
can make changes to its contents and styles and see the effect
of those changes immediately in the Preview window. In the
figure below, I have changed the style for the paragraph
tag to add the color: red.</p>
<div class="image">
<img alt="Inspector window Styles in red" src="../Images/tutorial-inspector-window-styles-red.png"/>
</div>

<p>You can see immediately in the Preview window
that all the paragraph tags show the text in red.</p>
<div class="image">
<img alt="Inspector window style change results" src="../Images/tutorial-inspector-window-styles-red-results.png"/>
</div>

<p>You can change the contents of the node as well.
Double-click on the contents of the paragraph to select it.</p>
<div class="image">
<img alt="Using Inspector window to edit" src="../Images/tutorial-inspector-window-edit.png"/>
</div>

<p>Enter the new text to see it change immediately in
the Preview window.</p>
<div class="image">

</div>


<div class="tip">
<p class="tiptext">Remember, since you are changing only the DOM in memory, none of the
changes that you make in the Inspector will change your HTML file.</p>
</div>

<p>Another feature of the Inspector is the Console, which
interprets JavaScript commands.</p>

<p>Once you have selected a node in the inspector tree, you can
access it using normal JavaScript commands in the Console. The Console
can be activated by switching to it with the Console
tab.</p>
<div class="image">
<img alt="Inspector window Console Tab" src="../Images/tutorial-inspector-console-tab.png"/>
</div>

<p>That results in the Console taking over the entire Inspector
window.</p>
<div class="image">
<img alt="Inspector Content Full area" src="../Images/tutorial-inspector-console-total.png"/>
</div>


<p>You can also place a Console panel beneath the Elements panel
by typing the Esc key.</p>
<div class="image">
<img alt="Inspector Console relocated" src="../Images/tutorial-inspector-console.png"/>
</div>

<p>The currently selected node in the Elements panel
is accessed using '$0'. The node that is accessed
using $0 is indicated in the
Elements panel where the tool has appended '== $0'
to the line of text that is selected.</p>
<div class="image">
<img alt="Inspector showing node id." src="../Images/tutorial-inspector-node-id-0.png"/>
</div>


<p>In the previous figure of the Console, you can see that I have
typed '$0' into the Console, and
it is displaying the contents of the selected node.
Clicking on the arrows in the Console allows you to dig
down into the node that is displayed.</p>

<p>You can use $0 to access and traverse the DOM tree
as you normally would with JavaScript commands. For example
you can access the parent of the selected node by typing
$0.parentElement. As you enter the command, autocompletion
popups are displayed to help you.</p>
<div class="image">
<img alt="Inspector Console using autocomplete" src="../Images/tutorial-inspector-console-autocomplete.png"/>
</div>

<p>You can use the mouse to select the desired method from the menu,
or you can type the Tab key to finish the selection by accepting
the highlighted element.</p>

<p>You can see in the following figure that the parent
of the selected paragraph node is the &lt;body&gt; node.</p>
<div class="image">
<img alt="Inspector Console to show parent" src="../Images/tutorial-inspector-console-parent.png"/>
</div>

<p>Once again, you can use the arrows in the Console output
to dig down into the node that you are inspecting.</p>
<div class="image">
<img alt="Inspector Console parent expanded" src="../Images/tutorial-inspector-console-parent-expanded.png"/>
</div>

<p>One last tip for using the JavaScript console is that
the Inspector tool keeps a history of selected nodes. The most
recently selected node is accessed using $0, and the node
selected before the current selection is accessed as
$1. In the figure below, I first selected the paragraph node,
and then I selected the image node. So $0 refers to the image
node, the most recent selection, and $1 refers to the paragraph node,
the previous selection.</p>
<div class="image">
<img alt="Inspector Console Node History" src="../Images/tutorial-inspector-console-node-history.png"/>
</div>

<p>Cascading style sheets are also
supported in the Inspector. 
The Styles panel provides information about cascading
styles.</p>
<div class="image">
<img alt="Inspector window shopwing Cascading Styles" src="../Images/tutorial-inspector-window-cascading-styles.png"/>
</div>

<p>In the figure above, the cascading styles are shown
with information about the source of each style. The styles
that are crossed out with a line through them, have been
superseded by the other styles in the display.</p>
