  <p class="h1subheading">— How-To Guides —</p>

  <p>Create your first EPUB ebook and learn about using Sigil with the tutorials in this section.</p>

  <p>Details on all of Sigil’s features can be found in the <a href="features.xhtml">Features</a> chapter.</p>

  <p>To give you an idea of what is involved in making an EPUB, here is an overview of the steps you might follow:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Convert your document to HTML (if it’s not an EPUB already) so it can be loaded into Sigil.</li>

    <li>Enter book details including Author and Title.</li>

    <li>Add a cover image.</li>

    <li>Create a Table of Contents.</li>

    <li>Validate your ebook against the EPUB standards.</li>

    <li>Test everything looks and works ok in Sigil.</li>

    <li>Test on actual e-readers – what works in one may not work on another.</li>
  </ul>
